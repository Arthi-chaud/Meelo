Meelo is a music server and application to enjoy your personnal music files anywhere, anytime you want.
This projet is made by a music collector, and for music collectors. Its goal is to have a clean, organized, easy and accessible way to store and serve files.

[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/fr/), [Beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets), [Koel](https://github.com/koel/koel), as well as iTunes are awesome solutions if you have a 'simple' music collection, but is not tailored for music collectors, who usually have multiple versions of a single album, multiple files for one single song (from multiple album releases). Therefore, the library ends up clustered and unpleasant to browse and use.

## What is the philosophy behind Meelo

The idea behind Meelo is to have a pleasant way to browse and enjoy your collection and making it the *best* one possible.

The *best* music collection is a collection that is fully useable in any music server (like one mentioned above). The only way to reach this goal is to make the music collection independant metadata-wise, i.e. having all the metadata embedded in the files themselves.
To use Meelo, you'll need a 'clean' collection: either with embedded metadata or standard file/forlder architecture. Using iTunes is a great way to start.

In the future, Meelo's goal is to help you manage and enjoy your music collection, while keeping it flexible if you ever want to use another music server.

## Features

- Manage multiple instances of a song, called *tracks*. While browsing, only one version, called *master*, will be listed. You can still access other tracks of the same song. Of course you can set which track is the song's master track.
