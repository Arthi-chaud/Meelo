# Docker and Docker-compose

In your `Meelo` folder, copy this [docker-compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arthi-chaud/Meelo/master/docker-compose.prod.yml) as `docker-compose.yml`. It can be used as-is.

Additionally, you should copy [nginx configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arthi-chaud/Meelo/master/nginx.conf.template) as is in your `Meelo` folder.
